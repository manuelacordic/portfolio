This project is a personal website created as part of a Capstone Project. Its goal is to showcase my skills, education, work experience, and interests through a clean and responsive design. The site is built entirely with HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript, to focus on semantic structure and styling best practices.

The website includes a hero section with a short introduction, a resume section presenting my education, work experience and skills, a projects section highlighting my previous work, an “About Me” section with more personal details, and a contact section with my address, email and phone number.

All HTML and CSS are written following best practices for accessibility and responsiveness. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, and all images include appropriate alt text. Bootstrap 5 is also used to simplify layout and styling.

This website serves as part of my portfolio and demonstrates my ability to combine technical skills from my Electrical Engineering studies with my passion for web design and front-end development.
